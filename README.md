# Operating System Labs
Building an operating system for Intel 80386 architecture.

## 📂 Structure
Each lab directory contains:
- `labX/` — Source code and build scripts
- `report/` — PDF report documenting design, implementation, and results
- *Lab Guide* — The original lab instructions and course guidance

## 🛠️ Environment
- **Architecture:** Intel 80386
- **Emulator:** QEMU
- **Toolchain:** GCC (cross-compilation), GDB, Binutils
- **Languages:** C, x86 Assembly
- **Platform:** Linux

## 📋 Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Bootloader
Write a simple bootloader to initialize the system and print messages.

### Lab 2: System Calls
Implement a basic system call mechanism and understand user–kernel interaction.

### Lab 3: Process Switching
Implement task scheduling and context switching between processes.

### Lab 4: Process Synchronization
Explore synchronization primitives and implement a simple locking mechanism.

### Lab 5: File System
Design and implement a minimal file system supporting basic operations.
